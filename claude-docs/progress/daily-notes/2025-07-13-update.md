## Major Breakthrough: Understanding kdapp's True Architecture

### Key Realizations

1. **Episodes are Ephemeral**
   - All state is in-memory only
   - Server restart = games lost
   - 3-day Kaspa pruning window
   - This is by design for fast development

2. **Rollback is Critical**
   - Every command must be reversible
   - Proper reorg handling via rollback stack
   - kasperience's patterns show the way

3. **kdapp.fun Architecture Clarified**
   - Like v0.dev: instant generation + immediate play
   - Server runs Episodes, handles blockchain complexity
   - Users just see a game interface
   - Shareable links for multiplayer

4. **Future-Ready Design**
   - kdapp has a persistence roadmap
   - We'll build interfaces that can evolve
   - Start with sessions, add persistence later

### Accomplishments Today

1. ✅ Added OpenRouter integration for flexible LLM selection
2. ✅ Fixed date issues (January → July)
3. ✅ Got domain name: kdapp.fun
4. ✅ Added "Show Code" feature to see generated Episodes
5. ✅ Clarified architecture: server-side Episodes, not "deployment"
6. ✅ Updated documentation with ephemeral nature

### Technical Decisions

1. **Full-Stack Rust Architecture**
   - Consistency with kdapp ecosystem
   - Axum for HTTP + WebSocket
   - Server-side Episode execution

2. **Focus on Session Games**
   - Quick, completable experiences
   - Clear user expectations
   - Perfect for POC

3. **Proper Rollback Implementation**
   - Every generated Episode must handle reorgs
   - Store enough state to reverse any action

### Next Priority Tasks

1. **Episode Runtime Module**
   - Compile generated code
   - Run Episodes on server
   - Handle multiple concurrent games

2. **Command Bridge**
   - UI actions → Episode commands
   - Create Kaspa transactions
   - Handle responses

3. **Update Code Generation**
   - Include proper rollback types
   - Test reorg scenarios

### Insights

The magic of kdapp.fun is hiding all blockchain complexity. Users type "make me chess" and get a working game instantly. The server handles Episodes, transactions, and reorgs - users just play.

This aligns perfectly with kdapp's vision: "fastest possible route for creative applications."
