# Daily Notes - July 14, 2025

## Overview
Completed major integration of kdapp Engine and Proxy with the Natural Language kdapp Interface, enabling true blockchain-based Episode execution with real-time updates.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. kdapp Engine Integration
- Successfully imported TicTacToe Episode from kdapp examples
- Created `kdapp_integration` module to manage Engine instances and Proxy connections
- Implemented proper Episode lifecycle management with NewEpisode messages
- Fixed Episode ID generation to use u32 (matching kdapp framework) instead of UUID strings

### 2. Server Wallet Implementation
- Built complete UTXO management system for transaction funding
- Integrated kdapp's TransactionGenerator for proper transaction pattern matching
- Implemented real-time UTXO fetching from Kaspa network
- Added proper change output tracking after transactions

### 3. Two-Player Game Support
- Added support for multiple test wallets (PLAYER1_PRIVATE_KEY, PLAYER2_PRIVATE_KEY)
- Implemented wallet selection based on URL parameters (?player=1 or ?player=2)
- Each player uses their own wallet to sign moves
- Proper turn enforcement with player-specific authorization

### 4. Real-Time Updates
- Connected kdapp Engine events to WebSocket broadcasting
- Implemented state persistence to handle reconnections
- Fixed broadcast channel implementation for multi-client support
- Board updates show X and O markers in real-time

### 5. Transaction Flow
- Transactions are properly created with Episode commands
- Successfully submitted to Kaspa testnet-10
- Proxy detects transactions with pattern matching
- Engine processes commands and updates Episode state
- State changes are broadcast to all connected clients

## Technical Challenges Resolved

1. **Episode ID Mismatch**: Fixed conversion from UUID strings to u32 Episode IDs
2. **Authorization Errors**: Switched from UnsignedCommand to SignedCommand with proper player keys
3. **UTXO Management**: Implemented proper tracking of spent UTXOs and change outputs
4. **WebSocket State Sync**: Added state persistence and initial state sending on connection
5. **Broadcast Channel**: Fixed SendError by implementing proper broadcast channel with state storage

## Testing Results

Successfully tested two-player TicTacToe game:
- Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O) can make moves from different browsers
- Turn-taking is properly enforced
- Invalid moves are rejected
- Game correctly determines winner
- All moves are recorded on Kaspa blockchain

## Current State

The POC now demonstrates:
- Natural language Episode creation
- Blockchain-based game execution
- Multi-player support with separate wallets
- Real-time state synchronization
- Proper integration with kdapp framework

## Next Steps

1. Improve UI feedback for move validation
2. Add visual indicators for current player turn
3. Implement Episode discovery/browsing
4. Add support for other Episode types (voting, auctions)
5. Create documentation for Episode developers
6. Consider persistence layer for Episode state

## Code Quality

- Fixed all compilation errors
- Added comprehensive logging
- Proper error handling throughout
- Clean separation of concerns
- Reused kdapp framework code effectively

## Lessons Learned

1. kdapp's TransactionGenerator handles all the complex pattern matching
2. Proper Episode initialization with NewEpisode is crucial
3. Signed commands are required for player authorization
4. Broadcast channels need at least one receiver or sends fail
5. State persistence is important for reconnection handling

The integration is now fully functional with blockchain-based multiplayer gaming working end-to-end!
