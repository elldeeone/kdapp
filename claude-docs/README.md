# Natural Language kdapp Interface Documentation

Welcome to the documentation hub for the Natural Language kdapp Interface project. This ambitious initiative aims to democratize blockchain application development by allowing anyone to create interactive Kaspa applications through simple text prompts.

## Project Vision

**"Make me a chess game"** ‚Üí Fully deployed blockchain game in minutes

Transform natural language into fully functional kdapp Episodes that run on the Kaspa network, enabling non-developers to create blockchain applications as easily as describing what they want.

## Quick Start

1. **New to the project?** Start with the [Architecture Overview](architecture/overview.md)
2. **Want to understand the technical approach?** Read [System Design](architecture/system-design.md)
3. **Interested in the AI aspects?** Check out [AI Models Research](research/ai-models.md)
4. **Ready to contribute?** See [Phase 1 POC Plan](implementation/phase1-poc.md)

## Core Concepts

### Natural Language Processing
Users describe their desired application in plain English:
- "Create a poker game for 4 players"
- "Make a decentralized auction house"
- "Build a prediction market for sports events"

### Episode Generation
AI models generate complete kdapp Episode implementations based on:
- User prompts
- Pre-built templates
- kasperience's authentication patterns
- Best practices from the kdapp ecosystem

### Automated Deployment
Generated Episodes are:
- Compiled and validated
- Deployed to Kaspa network
- Made accessible via shareable links
- Monitored for activity

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: kdapp (Rust-based)
- **Blockchain**: Kaspa (10 blocks/second)
- **AI Models**: Claude, GPT-4 (evaluation ongoing)
- **Web Framework**: Axum + WebSocket
- **Frontend**: Modern web stack (TBD)

## Acknowledgments

This project builds upon:
- The kdapp framework by Michael Sutton
- kaspa-auth patterns by kasperience
- The broader Kaspa developer community
